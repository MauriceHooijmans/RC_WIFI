# RC_WIFI
 Using NodeMCU to control RC servos and ESC thru WiFi.

# Credits
RC_WIFI.INO is based on code from https://github.com/programmer131/nodemcuCar/blob/master/carCode/carCode.ino

/data/virtualjoystick.js > is a modified version of https://github.com/jeromeetienne/virtualjoystick.js/blob/master/README.md

# Instructions
# Simple Instructions
Note: before you upload the code make sure you have "ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload" installed

1.Upload the code from the .ino into your NodeMCU with the Arduino

2.Upload the data folder contents to SPIFFS https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin


# How to get ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload to upload to SPIFFS

1.Make sure you use one of the supported versions of Arduino IDE and have ESP8266 core installed.

2.Download the tool archive from releases page. > https://github.com/esp8266/arduino-esp8266fs-plugin/releases and download ESP8266FS-<most recent version>.zip

3.In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create "tools" directory (if it doesn't exist yet). > You can find the location of your sketchbook directory in the Arduino IDE at File > Preferences > Sketchbook location.

4.Unpack the zip file into "tools" directory (the path will look like <sketchbook directory>/tools/ESP8266FS/tool/esp8266fs.jar).
Note: On OS X and Linux based OSs create the tools directory in ~/Documents/Arduino/ and unpack the files there.

5.Restart Arduino IDE. < Important step else it will not be loaded and not show up in the menu.

# Uploading to NodeMCU
1. Create a new sketch with the code from RC_WIFI.INO and save.
2. Go to sketch directory (choose Sketch > Show Sketch Folder).
3. Create a directory named "data" and copy the files from the data folder.
Note: Make sure you have selected a board, port, and closed Serial Monitor.
4. Select Tools > ESP8266 Sketch Data Upload menu item. This should start uploading the files into ESP8266 flash file system. When done, IDE status bar will display SPIFFS Image Uploaded message. 
5. And if not done yet press the regular upload button to upload the code.

6. just to be sure RESET your NodeMCU for a clean boot.
7. Grab your phone and search for a Wifi Access Point called "RC_WiFi" with password "W1r3L3ss".
8. Open your browser and browse to 192.168.2.1

This should open the NodeMCU's Web Interface wich in portrait will give you a 1 stick joystick and in landscape a 2 sticks controller.

# Disclaimer
This code is a work in progress and is not finished.
Be carefull: as metal objects could interfere with Wifi signals, 
I did what i could to prepare for lockouts and stopping the RC Motor altough there is always a chance for it to still go full throttle.
I will be in no way responsible for injuries or braking of your RC equipment.
